# Answers to Technical Questions

### 1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I spent 70% of the allocated time on architecture and solution design. After completing the architecture and clarifying the technical aspects of the task, I proceeded with the coding.  
If I had more time, I would focus on writing behavioral tests and implementing data encryption for transmitted data using RSA and AES. Additionally, I would enhance the system's security measures.  

### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your language of choice?
The most useful feature is **.NET Aspire**, an opinionated, cloud-ready stack for building observable, production-ready, distributed applications. It is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that address specific cloud-native concerns and is available in preview for .NET 8.  

### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down performance issues in production, I would use monitoring systems and logging tools such as ELK (for log storage) or Sentry. Additionally, I would use tools like Lens or OKD panels to review logs, trace system behavior, and analyze performance metrics.  

### 4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn?
The latest technical conference I attended was a .NET conference called "استاد کار 2" (Master Worker 2). I learned about some technical approaches in .NET, reviewed the latest .NET features, and gained insights from shared experiences in leading systems.  

### 5. What do you think about this technical assessment?
It is very intelligently designed, allowing individuals to tackle the task based on their experience and knowledge. It evaluates various aspects effectively.
